            Since the 1950s, men have made statements with their hair.
            Hairstyles like the pompadour landed on the scene, bringing men’s
            hairstyles into fashion for bad boys and celebrities like Elvis
            Pressley. They were followed in the 1960s and 1970s by the longer
            styles of the music industry, like The Beatles, and movies like John
            Travolta. Eventually, hair bands brought rocker styles to the
            forefront. In short, your hair is a part of your image and one of
            the first things people notice about you. It can become an entire
            identity all on its own, making your hair just as important as the
            clothes you wear when sending a message.

            Your skin doesn’t end at your neck, nor does the need to care for
            it. Men tend to neglect our skin below the neck because it is under
            the clothes, and no one sees it anyway, right? We have been duped
            into believing that the 3-n-1 shampoo, conditioner, and body wash
            are good enough for you. Your hair and your body will both tell you
            that isn’t true. Your products will impact how you look, smell, and
            feel in your skin.

            The truth is, your natural body musk is probably not what you hope
            it is. It is essential that you find the right scent that is subtle
            but noticeable, never overpowering. Technically, you should have
            eight different scents, one for day and night for every season of
            the year, but most men have one or two, so here are two choices, one
            for work and one for play.
